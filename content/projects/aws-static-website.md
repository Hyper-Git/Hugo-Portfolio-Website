This is my first AWS project where I'm learning to host a static website using Amazon S3.

## Project Overview

I built this portfolio website using Hugo and deployed it to AWS using:

- **Amazon S3** for static website hosting
- **CloudFront** for content delivery network (CDN)
- **Route 53** for domain management

## Technologies Used

- **Hugo** - Static site generator
- **Amazon S3** - Object storage and static website hosting
- **CloudFront** - Content Delivery Network
- **Route 53** - DNS management

## What I Learned

- How to configure S3 buckets for static website hosting
- Setting up CloudFront distributions for better performance
- Managing DNS records with Route 53
- Working with Hugo for static site generation

## Challenges Faced

- Understanding S3 bucket policies for public access
- Configuring CloudFront properly for custom domains
- Learning Hugo's templating system

## Next Steps
